## Article ID: 8-5-2015 PS

For this article you should focus on the findings reported for experiment 3.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Results
Results were coded from videotape by a coder blind to
the condition and the child’s final choice. If, in the coder’s
judgment, the puppets were not placed equidistant
from a child, that child would have been excluded from
analysis, but no children were excluded on these grounds.
One subject was dropped because of experimenter error,
2 were dropped because they left before the experiment
concluded, and 5 were dropped because of parental
interference. In addition, 10 children (2 in the play condition,
5 in the nicer condition, and 3 in the nicer baseline
control) were excluded from analysis because they failed
to respond in the first 30 s. Thus, the final sample included
16 subjects per condition.
Figure 2 shows the results from this experiment. In the
play condition, 81.25% of children chose the competent
agent (13 subjects; CI = [68.75%, 100%]). Thus, this condition
replicated the findings of Experiment 2. By contrast,
children in the nicer condition tended to choose the less
competent agent. Of the 16 two-year-olds who made a
choice, only 31.25% (CI = [6.25%, 50.00%]) chose the competent
agent (5 subjects). That is, the subjects’ choice of
the competent agent dropped from 81.25% to 31.25%
when they were asked to judge which agent was nicer
(CI = [21.05%, 81.67%]; p < .05, Fisher exact test). Finally,
subjects’ performance in the nicer baseline condition suggests
that this difference between the play and nicer conditions
was not due to children’s baseline belief that less
competent agents are nicer. Whereas only 68.75% of subjects
(11 out of 16) chose the incompetent agent in the
nicer condition, 31.25% of subjects (5 out of 16) chose the
incompetent agent in the nicer baseline condition, a
decrease of 37.5% (95% CI = [6.17%, 71.03%]; p < .075,
Fisher exact test). This suggests that toddlers do not simply
assume that incompetent agents are sympathetic; rather,
they take into account the relative cost of agents’ actions.
When both puppets refused to help, the toddlers
might have inferred that the less competent agent was
nicer because they exonerated the less competent agent
from performing a costly action, because they judged the
more competent agent harshly for refusing to perform a
low-cost action, or both. Further research might shed
light on the precise inferences that underlie children’s
social evaluations in this paradigm. However, note that neither agent was canonically nice: Both agents explicitly
refused to engage in a helpful action. If our subjects
understood “nice” only with respect to nice, helpful
behaviors, rather than with respect to internal motivations,
then they should have chosen a puppet at chance
or refused to answer. Instead, these 2-year-olds were able
to use differences in the agents’ costs to identify the nicer
of two unhelpful agents.
